## Description

The application is to be used for event planning or organizing large groups of people all from one app. After making an account,the user will be able to access all of their events and see all the events created on the app. You can click on an event to see more details. You can click the Add Event button to create a new event.

This app was developed by Seamona Stewart, Fisher Davis and Noah Brunner.

### Challenges and Future Development

Our biggest challenge was simply time. We were putting together everything we've learned at each step of this project, which meant that we simply didn't have the time to implement everything we wanted.

In the future, we'd like to add the ability to edit and remove events, the ability to comment on events and the ability to sort through events better.
